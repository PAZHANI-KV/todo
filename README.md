This is a simple CRUD todo list project where we can be able to create, read, update and delete data.
I have created the project by creating seperate and clean resuable components for each and every functions.
Used Reactjs for front end UI developmentand used nodejs for backend and mongodb for database management system.
There is a small error in backend deployment and thats the reason for data fetching but you can be able to address the quality of the code by examining the code in through the repository link.
